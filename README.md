## Problem Statements

### Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time

Write a function that converts a 12-hour time (e.g., "8:30 am" or "8:30 pm") to 24-hour time (e.g., "0830" or "2030").

### Challenge 2: Two numbers are positive

Write a function that takes three integers as arguments and returns `True` if exactly two of the three integers are positive numbers, and `False` otherwise.

### Challenge 3: Consonant value

Given a lowercase string with alphabetic characters only, calculate the highest value of consonant substrings. Consonants are letters of the alphabet except "aeiou", with assigned values a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, ..., z = 26.
